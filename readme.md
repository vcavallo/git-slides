# Hi!

These are the slides for a presentation to the Wondersauce weekly dev meeting on
April 13, 2016. They make a lot less sense without the accompanyment of the live
exploration of a `.git` folder and `git cat-file` that following along in a
terminal window nearby.

This presentation was made with [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark), which
is an in-browser slideshow tool that allows you to write markdown (and some CSS)
to do all the things you'd ever need for a slide presentation. I think I'm in
love with it.

## To view this

Once you've cloned this repo, just open `home.html` in a browser window and
start hitting the arrow keys. That's all there is to it. (you can press `p` to
enter "presenter mode" which will also show my notes alongside the slides)

When I presented this I was on a different branch of this repo where I had the
markdown slides in a separate file and included that file in the `home.html`
file. It's easier to write that way, but then requires running a local server -
which makes sharing this presentation and advising how to view it way more
annoying. You're looking at a branch (`serverless`) that moved things around so
you can simply open the html file in your browser.

enjoy!
