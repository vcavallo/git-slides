???
- git init

- git log - this is boring
- git-generate-history 2 example-file rb
- go to next slide!

# `git-generate-history`

This is cool, but it's a tangent. Don't pay attention to this.

**It's just generating some random files and commiting them to make some history.**

I'll post it in Slack later...

???
- tell them to read the above while you do stuff
- now run: git log - now there's some stuff there

# Plumbing and Porcelain

## `git cat-file`



???
- usually we interact with the 'porcelain'
- but git is built from 'plumbing'
